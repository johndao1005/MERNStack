# NFT (Non-fungible token)

When talking about NFT, we need to talk about Web 3.0, the concept point toward the third generation of internet services which focus on the goal of creating more intelligent, connected and open websites. Previously, ten years were taken to transition from Web 1.0 to Web 2.0 and expected the same duration or more would be needed for Web 3.0 to be implemented and becomes a solid definition.

NFT can be described as a unique digital record of ownership of a specific digital asset, stored on the blockchain. The digital asset can be any digital file or data such as pictures, video, audio and any data which can be stored on the blockchain but what makes it stands out is the integration with the blockchain which ensure the authenticity of the asset, especially from creditability creator as well as the ownership of the token. At first, NFT was considered the future of art in the digital age but with time and improvement in technology, the token will also provide exclusive access to the community, real-world events, merchandise or special perks. For Kai Rescue, NFT could be a part of the website solution through its authenticity feature. With authenticity, the token could be verified and tracked through blockchain which provided all the information and transaction history regarding the token. The token could be sent out to beneficiaries who are deemed to qualify to receive the goods and services from Kai Rescue and therefore, Kai Rescue could monitor the token's owner activity as well as benefits from Kai Rescue. The data could allow the organisation to show their activity to investors or donators and receive further support with funding or manpower. At the same time, while the token is issued for the beneficiary to receive support from Kai Rescue, the token can be transferred or sold for certain financial advances. Lastly, with the NFT collection, an organisation can manage all the tokens and information without the need for a database service and security as it is part of NFT and blockchain features.

As new and exciting technology, NFT and cryptocurrencies in general, also have their shortcomings which as their impact on the environment. It is understood that a transaction on the blockchain would take a considerable amount of computing power to be completed and some research shows that a single transaction has the same carbon footprint as 300,000 VISA transactions or 22,500 hours of watching Youtube. The consumption occurs with all the blockchain transactions and is not limited to NFTs alone and with Ethereum as the mainnet working on their solution to decrease the energy usage on their mainnet. Moreover, alternative options such as less energy consumption networks such as Solana, Cardano which NFT is also available. While the date for the Ethereum update is unknown, it can be described as the next breakthrough for Web3.0. First would be an expected decrease of 99.95% carbon footprint which currently equals the annual power consumption of Finland due to the transition from minting tokens which is the main culprit for energy consumption, into staking which is a locking mechanism which requires the user to lock up a certain amount of cryptocurrency to gain more tokens. With the integration of Ethereum 2.0, NFT would be more accessible to the public, unlike the current situation which requires an above-average budget to start an NFT collection. Currently, for some particular cases, NFT could be considered as a digital passport for access to closed communities or access to real-life benefits such as concert tickets, access passes to events... In my opinion, NFT could process and potentially take part in our everyday life with its unique and ownership features in the future when the Web3.0 transition is complete and the technology is accessible and become a common norm. For example, a property can be represented as an NFT on blockchain and the ownership of the property can be proven easily and the transfer of ownership is much more credible. 

In conclusion, Non-fungible tokens can be a nice addition to the Kai Rescue web application and join the Web3.0 movement, the token can act as an authentication system as well as provide transaction history for the organisation. While it is convenient, further refinement is needed before the technology can be available for general public usage, especially before the emergence of Ethereum 2.0. Lastly, the carbon footprint would be the biggest concern when it comes to NFT and cryptocurrency even with the improvement in technology so it is recommended for businesses and organisations to consider the transition toward NFT.
